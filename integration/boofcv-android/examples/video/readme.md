This example demonstrates use of Camera2 API with BoofCV's integration library to simplify 
capturing images and displaying the results. Much of the tedious handling of the Android
life cycle, image formats, and other book keeping has been taken care of for a more streamlined 
development of computer vision applications.

Support for Camera 1 API has been deprecated and will eventually be removed from boofCV.  
For Camera 1 API it's recommended that you use BoofCV v0.29 or earlier.
