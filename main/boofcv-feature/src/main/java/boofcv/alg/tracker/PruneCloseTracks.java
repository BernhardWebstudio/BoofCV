/**
 * Detects if tracks are too close together and discards some of the close ones.  Tracks are projected into
 * a smaller grid (specified by scale) and if more than one lands on the same grid element it is pruned. An ambiguity
 * resolver is used to decide which track to keep if there's a conflict. If the resolver says they are equivalent
 * then featureID is used. Results should be consistent independent of order in tracks list.
 *
 * This is designed to work with different types of track data structures.
